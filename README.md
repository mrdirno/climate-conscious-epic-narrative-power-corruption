## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene from the perspective of a mid-level bureaucrat in the European Federation who discovers their 'Green Accord' relief funds are being quietly rerouted to a Strand-owned logistics firm.
- Draft the journal entry of Aris Thorne, the night after the hangar meeting, as he grapples with the exhilaration of his model being chosen and the first cold flicker of what 'making it real' will actually require.
- Imagine a conversation between Leo Voss and a former comrade from his Jakarta protest days, who now leads a climate refugee aid group. They meet by chance, a decade later, on opposite sides of a new border.
- Create a 'leaked' internal memo from Erebus Dynamics, outlining the 'Thessaly Proposal's' Phase One: identifying five national governments most likely to collapse from climate stress, and the assets to acquire in the aftermath.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for the 'Thessaly' control system: a global dashboard that allocates water, energy, and arable land not by country, but by biome and efficiency metric. What data is visualized, and what is hidden?
- Develop a narrative game prototype where the player must manage a 'biome sector' using the Thessaly framework. The core mechanic is balancing resource efficiency, population stability, and suppressing 'sentiment-based' dissent to maintain your stewardship score.
