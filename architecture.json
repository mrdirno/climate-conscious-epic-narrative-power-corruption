  "cover_prompt": "A colossal, monolithic corporate ark-city, its sleek black spires and geometric gardens rising defiantly from a flooded, storm-wracked world, acts as both sanctuary and sovereign entity over the drowning planet below. The scene is a breathtaking yet terrifying vista of high-tech utopian architecture built upon global catastrophe, with the ark's mirrored surfaces reflecting the churning, oil-slicked seas and the desperate, tiny lights of submerged cities, encapsulating the themes of unilateral control and catastrophe commodification. In the atmospheric style of Simon Stålenhag and Beksinski, blending eerie hyper-detailed realism with profound dystopian grandeur and a touch of cosmic horror. Book cover framing, centered on the imposing ark, shot from a low, dramatic angle from the waterline to emphasize its overwhelming scale and power, with a single defiant figure silhouetted on a lower balcony gazing out at the ruined world. Volumetric, cinematic lighting with cold, clinical LED light from the ark structures cutting through the warm, toxic glow of a perpetual sunset and the deep blues of the endless ocean, palette of gunmetal black, corporate cyan, rusted amber, and deep oceanic teal. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
